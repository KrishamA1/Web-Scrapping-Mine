# Automated PDF Downloader for Gorkhapatra E-Paper

This project automates the process of downloading PDF files from the [Gorkhapatra E-Paper website](https://epaper.gorkhapatraonline.com/single/gorkhapatra) using Python and Selenium. The script is designed to locate and download all PDF links available on the webpage directly into a specified folder.

## Features

- **Automated Browser Interaction**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to interact with the webpage.
- **Dynamic Element Handling**: Waits for elements to load and handles delays effectively.
- **Custom Download Directory**: Downloads PDFs into a dedicated folder (`NewsToday`).
- **Headless Mode Support**: Can be configured to run without displaying the browser.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manages timeouts and missing elements.
